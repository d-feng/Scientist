ðŸš€ Motivation
 With the rapid advancement of AI, we have the potential to unravel some of the most complex challenges in medicine and biology. As Dario Amodei eloquently stated in discusses the future of U.S. AI leadership in CFR:
"Dealing with things like cancer, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, major depression, these are system-level diseases. If we can solve these with AI at a baseline, regardless of kind of the job situation, we will have a much better world."
This project is inspired by that visionâ€”leveraging AI and explore potential of AI as catalysts for scientific discovery and a force for good.
