## üöÄ Motivation  

 With the rapid advancement of AI, we have the potential to unravel some of the most complex challenges in medicine and biology. As **Dario Amodei** eloquently stated:  

> *"Dealing with things like cancer, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, major depression, these are system-level diseases. If we can solve these with AI at a baseline, regardless of kind of the job situation, we will have a much better world."*

This project is inspired by that vision‚Äîleveraging AI and computational approaches to accelerate research, decode intricate biological systems, and drive breakthroughs in healthcare. The intersection of machine learning, computational biology, and systems medicine opens the door to innovations that can transform lives.  

Join and be part of a movement that believes **AI is not just a tool but a catalyst for scientific discovery and a force for good**.


## üìú Project Overview  

This repository includes scripts designed to integrate AI-driven hypothesis generation into biomedical research. Below is an introduction to each script:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `cosci_public.py`  
**Purpose:** This Co-scientist script demonstrates how to use `langgraph` for hypothesis generation in drug repurposing. It provides an example of leveraging structured AI reasoning to identify potential new uses for existing drugs.  

**Key Features:**  
‚úÖ Implements `langgraph` to drive automated hypothesis generation  
‚úÖ Applies rationales through prompts  
‚úÖ Aims to evaluate the power of LLM X Agent  

**Usage:**  
Use Notebook
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Folder `OpenAI_Agent`
**contain examples of using openai agent sdk **
### Folder 'Claude MCP'
** test MCP server for use.
