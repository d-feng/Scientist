Response ~ β_0 + Σ(β_k × AAb_k) + ε
```

Use logistic regression to identify which autoantibodies predict IO therapy failure:
- Get odds ratios for each AAb
- Identify critical AAb threshold titers

**Key output**: AAb risk profile (e.g., anti-IFNγ AAb > threshold → non-responder)

### **Phase 2: Build Transcriptomic Proxy (Dataset 2)**

Since you lack AAb measurements in dataset 2, you need to infer AAb presence from **transcriptomic discordance**:

#### **A. Cytokine-Pathway Discordance Score**
```
Discordance_i = Cytokine_expression_i - Downstream_pathway_activity_i
```

**Logic**: 
- High cytokine gene expression + Low pathway activity = likely neutralizing AAb
- Example: High *IFNG* mRNA but low ISG (interferon-stimulated genes) = anti-IFNγ AAb?

**Mathematical implementation**:
```
For each cytokine i:
  Cytokine_score = log2(cytokine_gene_expression)
  Pathway_score = ssGSEA(downstream_signature_genes)
  
  Discordance_i = z_score(Cytokine_score) - z_score(Pathway_score)
  
  If Discordance_i > threshold:
    → Predicted AAb_i = HIGH# For each of 20 cytokine signatures
for signature in cytokine_signatures:
    # Score pathway activity in dataset 2
    pathway_activity[signature] = ssGSEA(dataset2_transcriptome, signature_genes)
    
    # Compare to expected activity based on cytokine expression
    cytokine_expr[signature] = mean_expression(cytokine_genes[signature])
    
    # Calculate suppression index
    suppression_index[signature] = (cytokine_expr - pathway_activity) / cytokine_expr
```

### **Phase 3: Link to Dataset 1 AAb Profiles**

Create a mapping function:
```
Predicted_AAb_profile(patient) = f(transcriptomic_suppression_patterns)
```

**Specific approach**:

1. **If you have overlap in patients** between datasets:
   - Train supervised model: `AAb_titer ~ transcriptomic_features`
   - Apply to dataset 2

2. **If completely separate datasets** (more likely):
   - Use biological knowledge to map:
     - Anti-cytokine AAb → specific cytokine pathway suppression
     - Example: Anti-IFNγ AAb → low IFNG signature despite tissue inflammation

**Matching matrix**:
```
         AAb_1  AAb_2  ...  AAb_10
Sig_1     w11    w12         w1,10
Sig_2     w21    w22         w2,10
...
Sig_20    w20,1  w20,2       w20,10
```

Where w_ij = biological prior (which AAb neutralizes which signature)

### **Phase 4: Patient Stratification Score**
```
IO_Readiness_Score = Σ(β_k × Pathway_activity_k) - Σ(γ_j × Predicted_AAb_j)
Where:

β_k from cytokine pathway importance (literature/biology)
γ_j from dataset 1 logistic regression (AAb effect sizes)


IO_Readiness_Score = Σ(β_k × Pathway_activity_k) - Σ(γ_j × Predicted_AAb_j)
                     \_____________________/   \________________________/
                            POSITIVE                    NEGATIVE
                         (Benefit term)              (Risk term)
```

## **Part 1: Σ(β_k × Pathway_activity_k)** - The "Immune Active" Term

### **What it represents:**
The total cytokine pathway activity weighted by importance for IO therapy response.

### **Components:**
- **k** = index for each cytokine pathway/signature (k = 1 to 20 in your case)
- **Pathway_activity_k** = Transcriptomic signature score for pathway k
  - Calculated via ssGSEA/GSVA from your 20 signatures
  - Example: IFNγ pathway score = 0.8, IL-2 pathway = 0.6, etc.
  
- **β_k** = Weight/importance coefficient for pathway k
  - **How to determine β_k:**
    1. **From literature**: Pathways known to predict IO response (e.g., IFNγ signaling strongly predicts anti-PD1 response)
    2. **From data**: If you have response data, fit: `Response ~ Pathway_1 + Pathway_2 + ... + Pathway_20`
    3. **Expert weighting**: Rank pathways by biological relevance (1-10 scale)

### **Example:**
```
Patient A:
  IFNγ pathway (β=2.0) × activity=0.8 = 1.6
  IL-2 pathway (β=1.5) × activity=0.6 = 0.9
  TNFα pathway (β=1.0) × activity=0.4 = 0.4
  ... (17 more pathways)
  
  Total positive term = 1.6 + 0.9 + 0.4 + ... = 8.5
