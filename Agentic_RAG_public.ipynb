      "- Antibody epitope redesign to avoid the CRD1 region that urelumab binds (which causes systemic hyperactivation and toxicity), e.g., bind CRD3 or CRD4\n",
      "- Fc engineering to modulate FcγR binding (e.g., Fc silent to avoid systemic crosslinking or selectively enhance FcγRIIB binding in tumor tissue)\n",
      "- Bispecific or multispecific formats to target tumor antigens and 4-1BB simultaneously and restrict 4-1BB activation spatially to tumor or tumor-draining lymph nodes (cis and trans settings)\n",
      "- Use of trispecifics or formats that have optimized 4-1BB to crosslinking target binding site ratios to induce optimal hyperclustering only in tumor context\n",

      "- Design antibodies targeting the membrane proximal CRD3/CRD4 region rather than distal CRD1\n",
      "- Engineer Fc region to silence or enhance specific FcγR interactions for selective crosslinking\n",
      "- Employ bispecific or trispecific formats targeting 4-1BB and tumor antigens (e.g., PD-L1, FAP, HER2) to localize activation\n",
      "- Optimize binding affinity ratios (4-1BB vs target) to promote tumor-specific hyperclustering\n",
      "- Use conditional activation strategies (e.g., ATP-dependent binding, protease-cleavable masks) to restrict activity\n",
      "- Develop recombinant multivalent proteins with mutated Fc to reduce systemic activation\n",

      "- Antibody epitope redesign to avoid the CRD1 region that urelumab binds (which causes systemic hyperactivation and toxicity), e.g., bind CRD3 or CRD4\n",
      "- Fc engineering to modulate FcγR binding (e.g., Fc silent to avoid systemic crosslinking or selectively enhance FcγRIIB binding in tumor tissue)\n",
      "- Bispecific or multispecific formats to target tumor antigens and 4-1BB simultaneously and restrict 4-1BB activation spatially to tumor or tumor-draining lymph nodes (cis and trans settings)\n",
      "- Use of trispecifics or formats that have optimized 4-1BB to crosslinking target binding site ratios to induce optimal hyperclustering only in tumor context\n",

      "==== GENERATING ANSWER ====\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The principal issue with 4-1BB agonists as cancer immunotherapy drugs is dose-limiting hepatotoxicity, especially with first-generation antibodies like urelumab, which caused fatal hepatitis, and limited efficacy at safe doses, as seen with utomilumab. This is due to systemic immune activation driven by both the antibody's epitope (urelumab binds membrane-distal CRD1, leading to strong systemic activation) and FcγR crosslinking, particularly in the liver. Utomilumab, which binds CRD3/4 and overlaps the ligand site, blocks 4-1BBL and fails to induce sufficient receptor clustering, resulting in poor efficacy at tolerated doses (0.0.2.7.0, 0.0.2.9.0, 0.0.2.10.0, 0.0.16.15.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome these issues, several antibody epitope and bispecific design strategies have been developed:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Epitope Design Suggestions:**\n",
      "- Avoid targeting the membrane-distal CRD1 region (as urelumab does), which is associated with superagonistic activity and hepatotoxicity. Instead, design antibodies to bind membrane-proximal CRD3/CRD4, which can avoid blocking 4-1BBL and may allow for safer costimulation (0.0.2.10.1, 0.0.16.15.0, 0.0.16.16.0, 0.0.16.17.0).\n",
      "- Consider tuning antibody affinity: Lower affinity variants of CRD3/4-binding antibodies can increase agonism while reducing ADCC/ADCP, potentially improving safety (0.0.16.16.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fc Engineering Suggestions:**\n",
      "- Engineer the Fc region to minimize or eliminate FcγR binding (Fc-silent), thereby reducing systemic crosslinking and hepatotoxicity (0.0.2.10.0, 0.0.16.18.0, 0.0.17.0.0).\n",
      "- Alternatively, selectively enhance FcγRIIB binding in the tumor microenvironment to promote local crosslinking and activation (0.0.2.12.0, 0.0.16.17.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bispecific/Multispecific Design and Format Suggestions:**\n",
      "- Use bispecific or multispecific antibodies that target 4-1BB and a tumor-associated antigen (e.g., PD-L1, FAP, HER2, B7-H3) to restrict 4-1BB activation to tumor or tumor-draining lymph node sites, thus minimizing systemic toxicity (0.0.2.12.0, 0.0.3.6.0, 0.0.9.12.0, 0.0.16.18.0, 0.0.17.0.0).\n",
      "- Optimize the ratio of 4-1BB to tumor-target binding sites (e.g., 2+1 or 3+1 formats) to promote efficient local receptor hyperclustering and activation even at low target expression (0.0.3.3.0, 0.0.3.6.0).\n",
      "- Employ conditional activation strategies, such as ATP-dependent binding or protease-cleavable masks, to further restrict agonist activity to the tumor microenvironment (0.0.16.17.0, 0.0.9.17.0).\n",
      "- Use engineered recombinant proteins with mutated Fc regions or fusion proteins to prevent FcγR-mediated crosslinking and localize activity (0.0.16.18.0, 0.0.17.0.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Bispecific Engineering Principles:**\n",
      "- Select IgG subclasses (IgG2, IgG4) with lower FcγR binding for reduced effector function, or introduce Fc-silent mutations (e.g., L234F, L235E, N297G) (0.0.9.6.0).\n",
      "- Use heterodimerization and chain pairing technologies (e.g., knob-into-hole, CrossMab, DuoBody) to ensure correct assembly and function of bispecifics (0.0.9.14.0, 0.0.9.15.0).\n",
      "- Consider fragment-based formats for improved tissue penetration, or Fc-fused formats for extended half-life (0.0.9.8.0, 0.0.9.9.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Actionable Summary:**\n",
      "1. Redesign antibody epitopes to bind CRD3/4, not CRD1, to avoid superagonism and hepatotoxicity.\n",
      "2. Engineer Fc regions to be Fc-silent or selectively enhance FcγRIIB binding in tumors.\n",
      "3. Develop bispecifics targeting 4-1BB and tumor antigens to localize activation.\n",
      "4. Optimize binding site ratios and affinities for efficient tumor-specific clustering.\n",
      "5. Use conditional activation (e.g., protease-cleavable masks, ATP-dependence) to restrict activity to tumors.\n",
      "6. Employ recombinant proteins with mutated Fc or fusion formats to prevent systemic activation.\n",
      "7. Combine with other immunotherapies for synergy and biomarker-driven patient selection for safety (0.0.3.12.0, 0.0.17.1.0).\n",

      "Explanation: The answer correctly identifies the hepatotoxicity and limited efficacy issues of first-generation 4-1BB agonists (urelumab and utomilumab) and links these to FcγR-mediated crosslinking and epitope differences, all of which are directly supported by the cited paragraphs (0.0.2.7.0, 0.0.2.9.0, 0.0.2.10.0, 0.0.2.10.1, 0.0.16.15.0). The proposed epitope designs (targeting membrane-proximal CRDs, tuning affinity) and Fc-engineering strategies (Fc-silent or enhanced FcγRIIB binding) are likewise grounded in the sources (0.0.16.16.0, 0.0.16.17.0, 0.0.16.18.0, 0.0.17.0.0). Bispecific and multispecific formats, site-restricted activation, binding-site ratios, and format engineering recommendations are all supported by the cited paragraphs (0.0.2.12.0; 0.0.3.3.0; 0.0.3.6.0; 0.0.9.6.0; 0.0.9.8.0; 0.0.9.9.0; 0.0.9.12.0; 0.0.9.14.0; 0.0.9.15.0). One minor overextension is the mention of protease-cleavable masks, which is not explicitly covered in the provided paragraphs, but this does not materially undermine the overall accuracy and support of the recommendations.\n",

      "==== FINAL VERIFIED ANSWER ====\n",
      "Verification: PASSED | Confidence: medium\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "The principal issue with 4-1BB agonists as cancer immunotherapy drugs is dose-limiting hepatotoxicity, especially with first-generation antibodies like urelumab, which caused fatal hepatitis, and limited efficacy at safe doses, as seen with utomilumab. This is due to systemic immune activation driven by both the antibody's epitope (urelumab binds membrane-distal CRD1, leading to strong systemic activation) and FcγR crosslinking, particularly in the liver. Utomilumab, which binds CRD3/4 and overlaps the ligand site, blocks 4-1BBL and fails to induce sufficient receptor clustering, resulting in poor efficacy at tolerated doses (0.0.2.7.0, 0.0.2.9.0, 0.0.2.10.0, 0.0.16.15.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome these issues, several antibody epitope and bispecific design strategies have been developed:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Epitope Design Suggestions:**\n",
      "- Avoid targeting the membrane-distal CRD1 region (as urelumab does), which is associated with superagonistic activity and hepatotoxicity. Instead, design antibodies to bind membrane-proximal CRD3/CRD4, which can avoid blocking 4-1BBL and may allow for safer costimulation (0.0.2.10.1, 0.0.16.15.0, 0.0.16.16.0, 0.0.16.17.0).\n",
      "- Consider tuning antibody affinity: Lower affinity variants of CRD3/4-binding antibodies can increase agonism while reducing ADCC/ADCP, potentially improving safety (0.0.16.16.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fc Engineering Suggestions:**\n",
      "- Engineer the Fc region to minimize or eliminate FcγR binding (Fc-silent), thereby reducing systemic crosslinking and hepatotoxicity (0.0.2.10.0, 0.0.16.18.0, 0.0.17.0.0).\n",
      "- Alternatively, selectively enhance FcγRIIB binding in the tumor microenvironment to promote local crosslinking and activation (0.0.2.12.0, 0.0.16.17.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bispecific/Multispecific Design and Format Suggestions:**\n",
      "- Use bispecific or multispecific antibodies that target 4-1BB and a tumor-associated antigen (e.g., PD-L1, FAP, HER2, B7-H3) to restrict 4-1BB activation to tumor or tumor-draining lymph node sites, thus minimizing systemic toxicity (0.0.2.12.0, 0.0.3.6.0, 0.0.9.12.0, 0.0.16.18.0, 0.0.17.0.0).\n",
      "- Optimize the ratio of 4-1BB to tumor-target binding sites (e.g., 2+1 or 3+1 formats) to promote efficient local receptor hyperclustering and activation even at low target expression (0.0.3.3.0, 0.0.3.6.0).\n",
      "- Employ conditional activation strategies, such as ATP-dependent binding or protease-cleavable masks, to further restrict agonist activity to the tumor microenvironment (0.0.16.17.0, 0.0.9.17.0).\n",
      "- Use engineered recombinant proteins with mutated Fc regions or fusion proteins to prevent FcγR-mediated crosslinking and localize activity (0.0.16.18.0, 0.0.17.0.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Bispecific Engineering Principles:**\n",
      "- Select IgG subclasses (IgG2, IgG4) with lower FcγR binding for reduced effector function, or introduce Fc-silent mutations (e.g., L234F, L235E, N297G) (0.0.9.6.0).\n",
      "- Use heterodimerization and chain pairing technologies (e.g., knob-into-hole, CrossMab, DuoBody) to ensure correct assembly and function of bispecifics (0.0.9.14.0, 0.0.9.15.0).\n",
      "- Consider fragment-based formats for improved tissue penetration, or Fc-fused formats for extended half-life (0.0.9.8.0, 0.0.9.9.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Actionable Summary:**\n",
      "1. Redesign antibody epitopes to bind CRD3/4, not CRD1, to avoid superagonism and hepatotoxicity.\n",
      "2. Engineer Fc regions to be Fc-silent or selectively enhance FcγRIIB binding in tumors.\n",
      "3. Develop bispecifics targeting 4-1BB and tumor antigens to localize activation.\n",
      "4. Optimize binding site ratios and affinities for efficient tumor-specific clustering.\n",
      "5. Use conditional activation (e.g., protease-cleavable masks, ATP-dependence) to restrict activity to tumors.\n",
      "6. Employ recombinant proteins with mutated Fc or fusion formats to prevent systemic activation.\n",
      "7. Combine with other immunotherapies for synergy and biomarker-driven patient selection for safety (0.0.3.12.0, 0.0.17.1.0).\n",
      "\n",
      "These strategies are supported by both preclinical and early clinical data, showing improved safety and efficacy profiles for second-generation 4-1BB agonists and bispecifics compared to first-generation agents (0.0.3.12.0, 0.0.16.19.0, 0.0.17.0.0, 0.0.9.12.0).\n",
