Automated Deep Search for scRNA-seq Tools Using OpenAI Agents
Overview
This project leverages OpenAI's Agents API to perform a structured deep web search for bioinformatics tools related to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The approach uses category-specific prompts to extract information about preprocessing, normalization, clustering, trajectory inference, and more.

By automating the search process, this method streamlines tool discovery, reducing manual effort while ensuring access to the latest resources from GitHub, official documentation, and research articles.

Setup Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install openai ipython nest_asyncio
2. Set Up OpenAI API Key
Replace API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key:

python
Copy
Edit
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "your_openai_api_key"
3. Enable Async Execution in Jupyter Notebook
To ensure smooth execution in Jupyter:

python
Copy
Edit
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
Implementation
1. Import Required Modules
python
Copy
Edit
from agents import Agent, Runner
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
import os

# Set up API key
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "your_openai_api_key"

# Enable nested async execution
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
2. Define Search Prompts
We use category-specific prompts to retrieve relevant tools in scRNA-seq analysis:

python
Copy
Edit
prompts = """Category-Specific Deep Search Prompts
1. Preprocessing & Quality Control
"Find at least 10 tools for preprocessing and quality control of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. Include tools for filtering low-quality cells, doublet detection, mitochondrial read filtering, and dataset quality assessment. Provide links to GitHub or official documentation."

2. Normalization & Batch Correction
"List at least 10 bioinformatics tools for normalization and batch effect correction in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Include methods like SCTransform, Harmony, and MNN. Provide links to documentation and GitHub repositories."

3. Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction
"Search for at least 10 scRNA-seq tools specialized in clustering and dimensionality reduction. Include methods using PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and graph-based clustering approaches. Provide official sources and GitHub repositories."

4. Differential Expression Analysis
"Identify 10+ software packages for performing differential expression analysis in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Compare statistical models used in each tool. Include links to their GitHub repositories or official documentation."

5. Trajectory Inference & Pseudotime Analysis
"List at least 10 tools for trajectory inference and pseudotime analysis in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Include methods such as Monocle, Slingshot, and SCORPIUS. Provide links to each tool‚Äôs documentation and GitHub."

6. Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Interactions
"Find at least 10 computational methods for constructing gene regulatory networks and inferring cell-cell communication from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Include approaches like SCENIC, CellChat, and NicheNet. Provide documentation links."

7. Visualization & Interpretation
"Gather at least 10 tools designed for visualization and exploration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Include interactive visualization software for gene expression, clustering, and trajectory analysis. Provide GitHub or official tool documentation."
"""
3. Execute OpenAI Web Search
We use OpenAI's responses.create() API call with a web search tool to find relevant resources:

python
Copy
Edit
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",  # or another supported model
    input=prompts,
    tools=[{"type": "web_search"}]
)
4. Extract and Display Search Results
To process and display the retrieved results as markdown:

python
Copy
Edit
# Extract all text from response content
output_texts = [content.text for message in response.output for content in message.content]

# Combine into one formatted string
formatted_text = "\n\n".join(output_texts)

# Display in Jupyter Notebook with markdown formatting
display(Markdown(formatted_text))
